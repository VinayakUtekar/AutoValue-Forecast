# AutoValue-Forecast 🚗

Welcome to our Car Resell Price Prediction project repository! This project utilizes the power of machine learning to predict the resale prices of cars, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions. Our solution is built using Flask for creating a user-friendly web application and Jupyter Lab for the exploratory data analysis and model development process.

📁 **Dataset**: We have employed the Quikr Car Dataset, sourced from the Kaggle website. This comprehensive dataset provides detailed information about various car attributes, including make, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and more. 

🔧 **Technology Stack**:
- **Flask**: Our user interface is developed using Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework in Python. The intuitive web application allows users to input car details and receive accurate resale price predictions.
- **Jupyter Lab**: The project leverages Jupyter Lab, an interactive environment, for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training. This enables transparency in our approach and facilitates collaboration among developers and data scientists.

📊 **Machine Learning**: We employ advanced machine learning techniques to create predictive models that factor in various car attributes to estimate resale prices accurately. Our models are trained on historical data and use algorithms such as linear regression, random forests, or gradient boosting to achieve optimal results.

🚀 **Key Features**:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Flask web application provides an intuitive and accessible platform for users to input car information and receive predicted resale prices instantly.
- **Data Visualization**: Jupyter Lab notebooks showcase exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization techniques, offering insights into the dataset and model development process.
- **Model Comparison**: We explore multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate model for resale price prediction, ensuring the best possible results.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Our project's architecture is designed for scalability, enabling future enhancements and model improvements.
